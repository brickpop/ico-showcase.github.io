* This website is an example of a general purpose Token Sale, build on the Ethereum network.

Ethereum is the second largest crypto currency in the world, and in contrast to Bitcoin, it allows organizations to develop immutable, transparent and unstoppable software.

An increasing number of projects is using Ethereum to create and exchange money (ether) with tokens. Depending on the case, token holders may have shares of a project, right to vote, participation on profits, etc.

2017 has been the year of the token sales boom. In November 2017, the total amount of capital raised has leapt to $3.6 billion. In fact, ICOs are now raising more money for start-ups than early stage venture capital.



* What is a smart contract?
A typical application will be running on a private server. It can be modified and brought down at any time.

A Smart Contract is a special piece of software that is deployed to the blockchain. A smart contract has the ability to codify the terms of a trade into a publicly immutable auditable program.

This enforces transparency, trust and certainty that an amount sent to smart contract will only be used as stated in the program code.

In addition to this, Smart Contracts eliminate the costs of server infrastructure, as they only need a one-time fee to deploy to the blockchain.
